## About Me

I am a Research Engineer and Data Scientist at **EDF R&D (EDF Lab Paris-Saclay)**, specializing in the analysis of electricity consumption time series.

My work focuses on developing innovative artificial intelligence solutions to enhance customer knowledge, improve electricity demand forecasting, and increase power system flexibility. I contribute to addressing strategic challenges in the energy sector by combining advanced data science methods with economic and statistical modeling.

### Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **machine learning, statistical modeling, econometrics, and energy systems analytics**, with a particular focus on:

- **Electricity load forecasting** using advanced deep learning architectures, machine learning techniques, and traditional statistical approaches.
- **Panel data econometrics** to quantify the impact of tariff signals on electricity demand and to estimate customer thermosensitivity.
- **Causal inference on panel data** to evaluate the effects of energy renovation policies on consumption patterns.
- Estimation of **solar self-consumption shares** and behavioral responses to distributed energy resources.
- Development of AI-driven tools to support demand anticipation and grid flexibility.

Overall, my objective is to design robust, interpretable, and scalable AI solutions that support the energy transition and improve decision-making in modern power systems.
